**Instructor:** Jorge Andrade, Ph.D.


## Learning Objectives

- Learn the basics of parallel and distributed computing environments.
- Get familiar with basic models for parallel computation, and design of parallel and distributed algorithms. 

## 1. Why Parallel Computing

Moore's law refers to an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. He noticed that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. Moore's law predicts that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future (exponential growth, it is unlikely to continue indefinitely, some new studie are showing that physical limitations could be reached this year - 2017) the number of transistors per square inch has since doubled approximately every 18 months.
The figure available on the link bellow shows the number of trasistors on integrated circuits chips from 1971 to 2016:

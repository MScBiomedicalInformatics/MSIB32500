  - Feel comfortable using Linux
  - Know how software works on Linux  and how to use it
  - Use bash to execute commands in Linux and know your way around the file system
  - Have an overview of Linux tools that are extremely useful for bioinformatics

## Log on to CRI's High Performance Computing (HPC) system

```bash
ssh username@tarbell.cri.uchicago.edu
```
Enter your **_password_** when prompted. Type yes if you are prompted to accept a key.

## How to get help

- Use the manual ($ man) command; to exit the manual type 'q'

## Navigation
1. List files in your home directory
```bash
ls            ### List the files in your current directory
ls -a         ### List the files in your current directory; do not ignore entries starting with .
```
2. Change current directory to the root of the file system and explore the directory structure
```bash
cd /          ### / represents the root of the file system
ls -l         ### List files in long format
pwd           ### Show the current directory
cd /tmp       ### Change current directory to /tmp
pwd
ls -l
```
3. Change to parent directory; one 'step' UP on the file tree
```
cd ..        
pwd
ls -l
```
4. Go back to your home directory
```bash
cd ~
pwd
```

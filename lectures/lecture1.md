This description assumes that you already have a
[user account on midway](http://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-account). If
you do not have a *midway* account, please ask the instructor for
access. If you plan to use a different computing resource (e.g.,
another compute cluster, your own laptop), the exact steps described
here, and in subsequent episodes, will be slightly different for you.

We will employ
[Pair Programming](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2492007.2492020) in this
workshop. Introduce yourself to your partner and decide between you
who will be the **driver** and who will be the **observer/navigator**.
(Of course, you may alternate these roles throughout the workshop.)

We will use the University of Chicago
[Google Docs](http://gdocs.uchicago.edu) to help make this workshop
more interactive, and encourage discussion. Open up the
[Workshop Google doc](http://tinyurl.com/h8y6p9p) in your Web browser,
and **introduce yourself**.

Log on to midway using ssh with X forwarding:

```bash
ssh -X username@midway.rcc.uchicago.edu
```

Request an **interactive session** using the reservation for this
workshop. To safeguard against losing your connection, I recommend
using **screen**, but this is optional.

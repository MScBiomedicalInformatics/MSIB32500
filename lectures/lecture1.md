# Introduction to Unix/Linux: 

**Center for Research Informatics, University of Chicago**

April - June 2017; Saturdays 9:00AM - 12:00PM

**Instructor:** Jorge Andrade, Ph.D.

**Teaching Assistant:** Wenjun Kang, Ms.C.

## Learning Objectives

- This training will teach you all you need to know to start using Linux, be it on the CRIâ€™s High Performance Infrastructure (HPC), or on your own computer (even if you are already running Windows or Mac OS).
- After this training you will: 
  - Feel comfortable using Linux
  - Know how software works on Linux  and how to use it
  - Use bash to execute commands in Linux and know your way around the file system
  - Have an overview of Linux tools that are extremely useful for bioinformatics

## Log on to CRI's High Performance Computing (HPC) system

In MacOS open the Terminal

:pushpin: If you are using a Windows machine (other than Windows 10 Anniversary Edition), you need install [MobaXter](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

```bash
ssh username@tarbell.cri.uchicago.edu
```
Enter your **_password_** when prompted. Type yes if you are prompted to accept a key.

## How to get help

- Use the manual ($ man) command; to exit the manual type 'q'
- Ask for help ($ your_command --help)
- Use the comand apropos ($ apropos text)

```bash
man ls
```
```bash
mkdir --help
```
```bash
apropos secure copy
```

## Navigation
a. List files in your home directory
```bash
ls            ### List the files in your current directory
ls -a         ### List the files in your current directory; do not ignore entries starting with .
```
b. Change current directory to the root of the file system and explore the directory structure
```bash
cd /          ### / represents the root of the file system
ls -l         ### List files in long format
pwd           ### Show the current directory
cd /tmp       ### Change current directory to /tmp
pwd
ls -l
```
c. Change to parent directory; one 'step' UP on the file tree
```bash
cd ..        
pwd
ls -l
```
d. Go back to your home directory
```bash
cd ~
pwd
```
## Operations with directories and files 

a. Create a new directory
```bash
mkdir mydir  ### Make a new directory called 'mydir'
mkdir newfolder1
ls -l 
```
b. Create a new file in a directory
```bash
cd mydir
nano file1.txt          ### Use nano editor to create a new file, write some text and use Control-O to save and Control-X to exit.
pwd
ls -l
```
c. Copy files and directories 
```bash
cp file1.txt copy.txt
ls -l
more copy.txt         ### Quick look to the contents of the file copy.txt
man more              ### Review the manual of the comand more; type q to exit
cp ~/mydir/*.txt ~/newfolder1/          ### copy all .txt files from mydir to newfolder1 
cd ~/newfolder1/
ls -l                 ### List the files you just copied
cd ..                 ### Change to parent directory
pwd
mkdir newfolder2
cd newfolder2
cp ~/newfolder1/file1.txt .     ### Copy file1.txt on current (.) directory
ls -l
cd ~
pwd
```
d. Remove a file or directory

```bash
cd newfolder1        
ls -l
rm file1.txt          ### Remove file1.txt
ls -l
cd                    ### Back to your home directory (this is equivalent to cd ~)
```

```bash
rm -r mydir           ### You will delete the whole mydir folder and all files on it, there is no way to recover those files
```
e. Rename a file or folder

```bash
cd newfolder1
mv copy.txt newname.txt         
ls -l
cd                              
mv newfolder1 newnamefolder                ### Rename newfolder1 with newnamefolder
```
f. Move files from one folder to another

```bash
mv newfolder2/file1.txt newnamefolder
```
g. Compress files

```bash
cd /group/bioinformatics/shared/MSIB32500/Lecture1/linux
ls -l SRR*                     ### List all files that start with SRR
gzip SRR001655.fastq           ### Compress a file, this command should create a compressed file named SRR001655.fastq.gz
ls -l                        
gunzip SRR001655.fastq.gz      ### Decompress a file
ls -l
```

:bulb: Download and Review the [LinuxReference.pdf](https://github.com/MScBiomedicalInformatics/MSIB32500/blob/master/cheatsheets/LinuxReference.pdf) file, a compilation of basic and most useful Linux comand for bioinformatics 

## File transfer between computers

a. Windows user download and install [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php). MacOS users open the Terminal
The *scp* (secure copy command) allows you to copy/move files between compters on the command line
```bash
scp example1.txt username@tarbell.cri.uchicago.edu:.
```
:bulb: The [hypexr.org](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) website has nice list of examples on how to use secure copy (also some [computer comics and cartoons](http://www.hypexr.org/comics.php))

b. You can use *wget* to get a file from the internet directly to your working directory in Linux
```bash
wget http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/curation/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff
```
## Input/Output redirect and pipe

a. Use the symbol '>' to redirect the output of a command to a file

```bash
nano text1.txt                       ### Create a new file and write some text on it
 
cat text1.txt                        ### Print file1.txt to screen
 
cat text1.txt > text2.txt            ### Print file1.txt to file2.txt
 
nano text2.txt                       ### Use nano to view file2.txt

```
b. Use the symbol '>>' to redirect the output of a command to a file using 'append'

```bash
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt           ### Append file1.txt to file2.txt
nano file2.txt                       ### View file2.txt
```
c. Use the symbol '<' to redirect the input
```bash
cat < file1.txt                      ### Print file1.txt to screen
```
d. Use the symbol '|' to pipe the output of one command as the input of another 

```bash
ls | wc -l              ### List the files and folders in the current directory and then count them
```
## Text extraction and manipulation

A standard Unix/Linux installation will have available several text editors (like: vi, vim, nano, emacs, and others) and text viewers (like: less, more, head and tail)

a. Use the symbol '>' to redirect the output of a command to a file

```bash
cd /group/bioinformatics/shared/MSIB32500/Lecture1/linux               
less SRR001655.fastq                 ### View a fastq file: use q to exit, space or f to the next page,
                                     ### b to the previous page, and / to search a word
head -20 SRR001655.fastq             ### Show the first 20 line of the file
tail -20 SRR001655.fastq             ### Show the last 20 lines of the file

```
b. Pattern Search with 'grep'. The grep command searches specified files or other input(stdin) for patterns matching a given expression(s).

```bash
> cat list1.txt                      ### See the contents of file list1.txt
apples
bananas
plums
carrots
 
> cat list2.txt                      ### See the contents of file list2.txt
Apple Sauce
wild rice
black beans
kidney beans
dry apples
 
> grep apple list1.txt list2.txt     ### Search for "apple" in list1.txt and list2.txt
list1.txt:apples
list2.txt:dry apples
```

# Introduction to Unix/Linux: 

## Learning Objectives

- This training will teach you all you need to know to start using Linux, be it on the CRIâ€™s High Performance Infrastructure (HPC), or on your own computer (even if you are already running Windows or Mac OS).
- After this training you will: 
  - Feel comfortable using Linux
  - Know how software works on Linux  and how to use it
  - Use bash to execute commands in Linux and know your way around the file system
  - Have an overview of Linux tools that are extremely useful for bioinformatics

## Log on to CRI's High Performance Computing (HPC) system

```bash
ssh username@tarbell.cri.uchicago.edu
```
Enter your **_password_** when prompted. Type yes if you are prompted to accept a key.

## How to get help

- Use the manual ($ man) command; to exit the manual type 'q'
- Ask for help ($ your_command --help)
- Use the comand apropos ($ apropos text)

```bash
man ls
```
```bash
mkdir --help
```
```bash
apropos secure copy
```

## Navigation
a. List files in your home directory
```bash
ls            ### List the files in your current directory
ls -a         ### List the files in your current directory; do not ignore entries starting with .
```
b. Change current directory to the root of the file system and explore the directory structure
```bash
cd /          ### / represents the root of the file system
ls -l         ### List files in long format
pwd           ### Show the current directory
cd /tmp       ### Change current directory to /tmp
pwd
ls -l
```
c. Change to parent directory; one 'step' UP on the file tree
```bash
cd ..        
pwd
ls -l
```
d. Go back to your home directory
```bash
cd ~
pwd
```
## Directory and file operations

a. Create a new directory
```bash
mkdir mydir  ### Make a new directory called 'mydir'
mkdir newfolder1
ls -l 
```
b. Create a new file in a directory
```bash
cd mydir
nano file1.txt          ### Use nano editor to create a new file, use Control-O to save and Control-X to exit.
ls
```
